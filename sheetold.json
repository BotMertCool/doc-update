      "CyHi ref track for Kanye. Leaked after a groupbuy on February 6th, 2021. Basically just different reference hooks, the instrumental for the No Malice verse from \"Use This Gospel\", and an extended Kenny G saxophone solo. Extremely likely this is post-April 2019 due to it having Kenny G and the Sunday Service Choir as Dua Lipa's final Yandhi version does not have either. Likely before Victory Boyd's version, as there seems to be the \"Use This Gospel\" hook with combinations of \"Law Of Attraction\".",
